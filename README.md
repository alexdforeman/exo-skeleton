exo-skeleton
============

Generic Ant build system.  This Project can be dropped into any Java project for a full build system with ivy dependencies, unit tests and static code analysis tools all ready to go.

So developing Cethrepoh in my spare time at home I started using Maven as it was an easy start in eclipse but always wanted to move it to an apache ant+ivy solution.  I realised when doing it that I end up doing this all the time with every Java build I do and its so generic that I might as well make it wasy for myself and create an ant+ivy template.

So here it is, it uses the Maven Project Structure for a Java project by default.  To use it drop these files into your project and type *ant*.

Im still developing this and theres loads to do so please let me know about any requests or just fork :)
